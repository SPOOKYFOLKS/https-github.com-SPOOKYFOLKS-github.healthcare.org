Access of healthcare facilities in rural areas



Access to healthcare services is critical to good health, yet rural residents face a variety of access barriers. A 1993 National Academies report, Access to Healthcare in America, defined access as “the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes.” A 2014 RUPRI Health Panel report on rural healthcare access summarizes additional definitions of access with examples of measures that can be used to determine access.

Ideally, residents should be able to conveniently and confidently access services such as primary care, dental care, behavioral health, emergency care, and public health services. According to Healthy People 2020, access to healthcare is important for:

Overall physical, social, and mental health status
Disease prevention
Detection, diagnosis, and treatment of illness
Quality of life
Avoiding preventable deaths
Life expectancy
Rural residents often encounter barriers to healthcare that limit their ability to obtain the care they need. In order for rural residents to have sufficient access, necessary and appropriate healthcare services must be available and obtainable in a timely manner. Even when an adequate supply of healthcare services exists in the community, there are other factors to consider in terms of healthcare access. For instance, to have good healthcare access, a rural resident must also have:

Financial means to pay for services, such as health or dental insurance that is accepted by the provider
Means to reach and use services, such as transportation to services that may be located at a distance, and the ability to take paid time off of work to use such services
Confidence in their ability to communicate with healthcare providers, particularly if the patient is not fluent in English or has poor health literacy
Trust that they can use services without compromising privacy
Belief that they will receive quality care
This guide provides an overview of healthcare access in rural America, including discussion on the importance and benefits of healthcare access and the barriers that rural residents experience. The guide includes information on:
